JShare - Share your Node.js server side variables with your client side Javascript. 
===============

Installation:
------

You can install it directly from npm:

    npm install jshare

Usage:
------

First, you need to add the JShare middleware to your Express app **make sure to add it before the call to app.router**:

**app.js**

    var jshare = require('jshare');
    app.configure(function(){
      app.use(jshare());
      app.use(app.router);
  });

Next, you need to make a call out to the JShare helper method in your layout file:

**layout.jade** (or whatever other view engine you're using)

    !!!
    html
      head
        title= title
        link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
        != JShare()
      body!= body

**Note**

In previous versions of JShare, you had to call includeJShare() in your view, however this is now incompatible with EJS (thanks to [minttoothpick](https://github.com/minttoothpick) for pointing this out). For backwards compatibility this will still work with Jade, however it is encouraged to use JShare() moving forward. 

And finally, in your routes file, you can now attach any variables to the Response:

**index.js**
    
    exports.index = function(req, res){
      res.jshare.person = {firstName : "Alex"};
      res.render('index', { title: 'Express' })
    };

Now, in your client-side javascript, all of your variables that you set on the server side, will be available to you:

**clientJS.js**

    alert(jshare.person.firstName);

Options:
------
**Namespace**

When calling the `jshare()` function from within your app.js, you can optionally pass in a `namespace` parameter. What that does is it prefaces the Javascript variables (both client and server side) with your custom namespace as opposed to 'JShare':

**app.js**

    var jshare = require('jshare');
    app.configure(function(){
      app.use(jshare('foo'));
      app.use(app.router);
    });

**index.js**
    
    exports.index = function(req, res){
      res.foo.person = {firstName : "Alex"}; //notice the res.foo instead of the res.jshare
      res.render('index', { title: 'Express' })
    };

**clientJS.js**

    alert(foo.person.firstName);

**Script Tag**

When calling the JShare() function from within the view, you can specify if you'd like to have the script tag automatically generated for you (this is the default) or not. You do this by specificying an options object:

**layout.jade** (or whatever other view engine you're using)

    !!!
    html
      head
        title= title
        link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
        != JShare({ outputScriptTag:true })
      body!= body

**Dynamic External JS File**

By default, the outputed JS gets put right where you call JShare in your view. If you'd rather have it be dumped in an external file, JShare provides the option to have a dynamic JS file be created, and the output of JShare() will be the path to that JS file: 

**layout.jade** (or whatever other view engine you're using)

    !!!
    html
      head
        title= title
        link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
        != JShare({ useExternalJSFile:true })
      body!= body
